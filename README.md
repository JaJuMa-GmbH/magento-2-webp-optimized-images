### Compatibility With All Browsers
As of today, all major browsers support WebP images. More than 90% of all internet users use a browser that supports WebP [(Source)](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp).
But with JaJuMa WebP Optimized Images also users with browsers without WebP support have no disadvantages or limitations.
As a fallback, for these users the "normal" version of your images namely .jpg or .png files will be served automatically.
